# Food cost. Uses for two people
Basically what this project does is that it'll calculate how much someone should pay each other, 
So it ends up so both people pay exactly the same amount.  Me and my sister use it every month as so we 
pay equally the same amount for the food each month, hence the name food cost :D. 
This program is run in the commando prompt and is in mainly in swedish. 
If someone willing have this english, im willing to provide a translation

Formula for calculation of how much they should pay Abs(cost diffrence for each person/2)  
and uses an if statement with < logical to print out who should pay who.

In this project i've been usuing list as storage of data. Which seems impractical as, i need to store the data permantly. 
And i think its good oppurtunity for me to learn more about data bases. 

I also have an idea how i could expand this idea with arbitary amount of people 
The calculation of how much they should pay each other becomes a bit more complicated.
The formula that i would use 
(cost diffrence between who paid the most the actual paying person)/2 
print "you should pay (name of the one who paid most)"  

But i don't find it intresting as i can't see any uses for it. Maybe if i get i third roomie, who knows! :)
